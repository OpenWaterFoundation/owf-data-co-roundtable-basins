# data-orig #

The `data-orig` folder contains original data files downloaded from various websites.  The contents of each file are described below, as well as the methodology used to obtain the data and mapping to the joined dataset.

## Colorado-IBCC-Basins-WGS84.geojson ##

This file is a map of Interbasin Compact Committee (IBCC) basins downloaded from the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)'s [Data Viewer](https://www.coloradodnr.info/h5v/Index.html?viewer=cwcbviewer).  The IBCC Basin layer is within the Admin Boundary Category.  The shapefile was opened in QGIS and the coordinate reference system was converted to WGS 84 so that the map can be viewed on GitHub.  The shapefile was then saved in GeoJSON format. 
OWF has included the file in the `data-orig` folder rather than the `data` folder because OWF has not currently made any additions to the map that add value.
